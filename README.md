# 🔐 Basic Firewall Configuration & Usage

## 📌 What is a Firewall?
A **firewall** is a security system (software, hardware, or both) that controls and monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.  

### ✅ Uses of a Firewall:
- Block unauthorized access.  
- Allow safe communication (e.g., web browsing, emails).  
- Protect sensitive data.  
- Prevent cyberattacks like **port scanning, malware injection**, etc.  

⚡ **In short:** A firewall is your *first line of defence* in network security.

## 🛡️ Windows Defender Firewall
**Windows Defender Firewall** is Microsoft’s built-in firewall that comes with Windows operating systems.  
It acts like a **security gate** that controls network traffic going in and out of your PC.  

### ✅ Why it’s important:
- Stops hackers from remotely accessing your system.  
- Prevents malware from connecting to command-and-control servers.  
- Lets you whitelist safe apps and block risky ones.  

⚡ **In short:** Windows Defender Firewall is your computer’s built-in shield that manages which data gets in or out of your system.

## 🔧 How These Measures Protect the Network
- Firewall configuration blocks **unauthorized traffic** and reduces the **attack surface**.  
- Changing default passwords prevents attackers from exploiting widely known credentials.  
- Enabling **WPA2/WPA3 encryption** secures wireless communication against interception.  
- These combined steps create a **layered defense (defense-in-depth)**.  

➡️ Even simple steps like these significantly reduce risks such as:
- Malware infections  
- Brute-force attempts  
- Eavesdropping
